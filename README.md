This Python script uses the Spotify Web API to search for top tracks for a list of artists and stores the results in a CSV file. It authenticates using client ID &amp; secret ID. The script reads the last artist found in the CSV file to resume searching where it left off. If an artist is not found, it writes the name to a text file for later reference.
